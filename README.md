# SOC Task 2 – Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

This project is part of my cybersecurity internship training. The goal was to simulate what a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst does: monitor alerts, investigate threats, and respond to incidents.

## What I Did

Loaded sample system and authentication logs into a SIEM tool.

Detected suspicious activities (failed logins, success after multiple failures, malware detections).

Classified alerts by severity (High/Medium/Low).

Built a simple dashboard showing login trends and malware detections.

Wrote an Incident Response Report with timeline, impact, and recommendations.

## Deliverables

Incident_Report.pdf – summary of findings and incident response steps

Alert_Classification.csv – log of suspicious events with severity ratings

Dashboard.png – combined SIEM dashboard screenshot

Screenshots/ – supporting evidence from log analysis

## Skills Gained

Basic log analysis & alert triage

Hands-on experience with SIEM dashboards

Incident reporting and documentation

Practical understanding of SOC workflows

This was a great learning experience and gave me a clearer picture of how SOC teams protect organizations every day.
